# Neural-Network-with-Mathematics-and-Numpy
This is an implementation of a neural network without fancy frameworks like; <br>
Tensorflow, Pytorch, etc. <br>
Just pure vanilla Numpy and Mathematical concepts.
I'm using the famous MNIST dataset to work on this repo.
If you're reading this, I hope you look at the notebook. You'll understand the basic concept of how neural networks <br>
