#  Custom Artificial Neural Network.
This is an implementation of an Artificial Neural Network using just mathematics and Python's numpy package, without fancy deep learning frameworks.
This network was trained on the famous MNIST dataset. The network achieved 93.5% accuracy on the test dataset.<br>  
All the functions used to build the ANN is available [here](https://github.com/ifunanyaScript/Artificial-Neural-Network-from-scratch/blob/main/functions.py)
If you're reading this, I hope you look at the [notebook](https://github.com/ifunanyaScript/Artificial-Neural-Network-from-scratch/blob/main/notebook.ipynb). I tried to simplify the mathematics behind neural networks and it's entirely easy to understand.<br>  
Drop a ‚≠ê, Thanks!
